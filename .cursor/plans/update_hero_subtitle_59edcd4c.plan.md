# Update Hero Subtitle Text

In `[src/components/blocks/landing/hero.tsx](src/components/blocks/landing/hero.tsx)`, line 547:

**Before:**

```
'Create consistent characters and scenes instantly.'
```

**After:**

```
'Generate high-quality illustrations in a consistent style.'
```

This is the subtitle shown when the user mode is set to "Creators" (not "developers").
